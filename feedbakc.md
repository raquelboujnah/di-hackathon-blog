Gigi and Eli, 
Good job overall, but there are areas for improvement. 
You need to handle errors more effectively — for example, as it stands, a user can post an empty blog, which shouldn’t be allowed. 
Additionally, your code could be more structured, and you could have added login, registration, and other features to enhance functionality. 
Keep going and working on refining these aspects!
